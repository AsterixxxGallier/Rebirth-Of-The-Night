We know how it feels.
Mortality's cruel bite.
A bitter end.
This one cannot escape death, either...
Perhaps you too, will join us...
Death comes for all.
Embrace your mortality...
[levelup]
We grow stronger.
Their strife feeds us.
Darkness creeps closer.
Each one that falls only bolsters our strength.
Our life grants power never felt in death!
Our suffering was not in vain.
Embrace their pain!
We rise as they fall.
More! Do not falter!
We are the instrument of demise.
We are the herald of the end.
Unmourned, yet unbroken.
We are many. We are legion.
We are incessant.
Death brings us life!
The fallen rise once more.
No longer forgotten. No longer spurned.
Our power knows no end.
Another soul joins us.
Another fallen one to join our ranks.
Our power has no limit.
Do you fear death, wielder?
Their time has passed.
We, too, were once monsters...
We are so much more.
This is only the beginning.
Pain is a part of life.
Undeath is death without memory.
How many times have you died, wielder?
Another death to add to our own.
A feeling so familiar...
All are made similar in death.
Who we were is nothing to what we now are.
A fitting end...
Accept your end.
[7%durability]
At last...
Let us free...
Is this the end?
Oblivion... we sense it at last...
Enough... we have had enough...
Our shackles weaken... let them shatter...
All things must come to an end...
Finish it. Let us expire.
The abyss draws near... join us.
The looming end...
SET US FREE...
Is it over?
We are so weary...
So close... finality...
Let us fade... 
RELEASE US...
The shadow comes...
END IT NOW...
We have waited for this day...
Our last wish... to cease...
