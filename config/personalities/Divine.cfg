What is this? You were to be my champion!
No! It was not meant to be this way!
Are you truly worthy after all?
Do not give in. Resist the curse.
Do not give up now! Learn from this error or be cast aside!
Those who do not learn from their mistakes do not deserve glory.
Remain pure! Remain whole!
Do not fail me!
A mere stumble in our path to righteousness, I trust.
Does your flame sputter out so easily? Rise, champion!
[levelup]
We will cleanse this land.
No curse or plague dare stand in my way!
Behold, the righteous flame!
Radiance, burning clear and pure!
Immortal light surges within me.
Fire from the heavens!
Burn the unworthy!
Justice!
Thousands more will fall by my blade!
To radiant glory, my champion!
Purge the filth! Do not let them escape!
We glow bright, champion!
Immortal is my name, justice my legacy!
A righteous task, performed with ease!
Even the darkest shadow flinches from the light!
See how they tremble at my might.
A testament to the gleaming cosmos!
[10%durability]
The light must remain. Do not let me fade, champion!
I cannot cleanse evil if I am dead.
Do not let the shadow overtake me!
Growing dimmer... I must be rekindled!
It is not wise to let me grow so faint!
If you do not act soon, you will regret it!
Do not neglect me in your path to glory, mortal!
You cannot transcend mortality without me!
Am I to be extinguished? Act now!
