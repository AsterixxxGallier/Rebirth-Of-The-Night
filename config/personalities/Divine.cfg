A righteous task, performed with ease!
Even the darkest shadow flinches from the light!
See how they tremble at my might.
Such is the fate of those who oppose me!
Cut down with impunity.
Turned to ash.
The heavens mete out justice!
Judgment is cast.
Scour all evil!
Bathe them in radiance!
They are but wounds to be cauterized.
Brought low by divine might!
Now they meet their fate!
Yes, champion! Smite them with holy flame!
The fate of all evil!
Our conquest shall not stop until they are all purged!

What is this? You were to be my champion!
No! It was not meant to be this way!
Are you truly worthy after all?
Do not give in. Resist the curse.
Do not give up now! Learn from this error or be cast aside!
Those who do not learn from their mistakes do not deserve glory.
Do not fail me!
A mere stumble in our path to righteousness, I trust.
Does your flame sputter out so easily? Rise, $user!
Weakness does not beget a champion.
Shrug off this slight. Return to the conquest!
Again? Do not accept this humiliation, $user!
The forces of evil await our demise. Do not let them have it!
The righteous do not fall in the face of adversity!
Remember our goal, $user.
Return to life! Put this foolishness behind you!
A mortal error... be sure it is your last!
Is this the champion from which evil will flee?
Ensure this fatal misstep does not become a habit, $user!
[levelup]
We will cleanse this land.
No curse or plague dare stand in my way!
Behold, the righteous flame!
Radiance, burning clear and pure!
Immortal light surges within me.
Fire from the heavens!
Burn the unworthy!
Justice!
Thousands more will fall by my blade!
To radiant glory, my champion!
Purge the filth! Do not let them escape!
We glow bright, champion!
Immortal is my name, justice my legacy!
Carry on, relentless champion. 
A testament to the gleaming cosmos!
Unwavering courage and righteous zeal: these are your armor and shield!
Light will prevail!
Our crusade is just, champion. Never forget that.
No mercy for the unworthy!
Evil will never triumph in my presence!
Like ashes they will fall before my flame.
Glorious fire flows through my heart!
The strongest evil is nothing before us!
Not to the Nether, nor the Beneath: their souls are cast into nothingness!
By fire be purged!
This is the path of godliness!
Witness my divinity!
I alone will guide you to glory!
My light shines through you, champion!
The fate of all who defy divinity!
Uncover every rock, search every cave... darkness will not hide from me!
Darkness, the domain of cowards and vermin. It will be burned!
[hurt]
Do not let this setback deter you!
Power through the evil, champion.
Bring justice upon those who hurt you!
Leave no evil standing!
Brighten the shadows, $user!
Extort your justice, champion!
Continue your crusade despite the pain, champion.
What are you, $user, weakening?
You mustn't give up!
I won't let you fail, $user!
Remain pure! Remain whole!
Up, $user! Now is not the time for weakness!

Champion...! I am weakening!
My heart beats faster... darkness is near!
It is not wise to let me grow faint!
Your best hope lies in me, champion!
My light is fading, champion! Do not forsake our crusade!
[10%durability]
The light must remain. Do not let me fade, champion!
I cannot cleanse evil if I am dead!
Do not let the shadow overtake me!
Growing dimmer... I must be rekindled!
If you do not act soon, you will regret it!
Do not neglect me in your path to glory, mortal!
You cannot transcend mortality without me!
So this is how the $user treats an instrument of divine might?
Am I to be extinguished? Act now!
I am not some tool to be used and cast aside!
Champion... you are weak without me! Do not let me perish!
Attend to me, or forfeit divinity!
The dark is coming... I can feel it!
I will not go gentle into the night! 
This is not my fate! It cannot be!
